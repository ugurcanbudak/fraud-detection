The data used for this project should be in a structured format, containing relevant features that can help identify fraudulent activities. The dataset should be split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

## Model Training

The model training process involves the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and normalizing the input data.
2. Feature engineering: Creating new features or selecting relevant features.
3. Model selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
4. Model training: Training the selected model using the training dataset.

## Evaluation

The performance of the fraud detection system can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, visualizations and confusion matrices can provide insights into the model's performance.

## Running the Pipeline

Before running the pipeline, ensure that the dataset is downloaded and unzipped. The data can be downloaded from Kaggle:

1. Go to the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
2. Download the dataset and unzip it.
3. Place the unzipped data in the `data` folder of this project.

To run the fraud detection pipeline, execute the `main.py` script. This script will preprocess the data, train the model, evaluate the model, and save the trained model to a file.

```bash
python main.py
```
